    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <h3>This is an unofficial website where we host tips and tricks for those who are attempting the Cyber Discovery programme. All these articles are written by past participants, most of whom reached the elite stage themselves. <br><br> However, DO NOT mistake this for a walkthrough website - here, we merely disclose tips that can help you, or hints that will give you a boost in progressing to later stages of the program. Any writeups posted here are permitted or already disclosed by the official Cyber Discovery Staff, or the saviour himself, James Lyne.</h3>
